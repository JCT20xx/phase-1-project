Phase 1 Project
Created a simple HTML
Created a simple css
Played around with the css
Starting on the JavaScript
Going to change to a differnt API as the one i chose seem disorganized for my purposes
Changed to use a pokemon API and it is a much cleaner api to work with
Added div to index.html to add in the pokemon info
Added the event listener to clear the page and a back button to reload list
Rearranged alot of the const for the tags but its working now
there is a forEach to get the pokemons typing and a forEach to get all the moves
