# Phase 1 Project: The Complete Pokedex

## Description
This is a simple project to create a front-end website from scratch using HTML, CSS, and javascript coding to pull and display data from an API.

## Usage
This site pulls the names of 'pokemon' and lists them out and has an event listner to repond to being clicked on providing more information about the chosen 'pokemon'. The page will then empty out the previously loaded list and load with the name, pokedex #, an image of the pokemon, and some statistics about what type they are, height and weight, and a list of their attack moves. There is also a back button with an event listener to repond to the button being clicked and clearing out the page and bringing back up the list.
