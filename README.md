# Phase 1 Project: The Complete Pokedex

## Description
This is a simple project to create a front-end website from scratch


=======
Phase 1 Project. 
Created a simple HTML. 
Created a simple css. 
Played around with the css. 
Starting on the JavaScript. 
Going to change to a differnt API as the one i chose seem disorganized for my purposes. 
Changed to use a pokemon API and it is a much cleaner api to work with. 
Added div to index.html to add in the pokemon info. 
Added the event listener to clear the page and a back button to reload list. 
Rearranged alot of the const for the tags but its working now. 
there is a forEach to get the pokemons typing and a forEach to get all the moves.
